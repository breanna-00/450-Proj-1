# 450-Proj-1

For our CECS 450 Project, we decided to create a Tag Cloud that takes in tweets from different House of Representatives members. The Tag Cloud shows the user how much a certain topic is talked about more than others through size changes (frequency). It allows the user to pick which House of Representatives member or members they wanna focus their Tag Cloud.
